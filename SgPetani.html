<h2>Sg.Petani, Kedah</h2>
<hr/>

<p><b>Sungai Petani</b> (abbreviated Sg. Petani or SP) is a town in Kuala Muda District, Kedah, Malaysia. Sungai Petani is Kedah's second largest town and is located about 55 km south of Alor Setar, the capital of Kedah, and 33 km northeast of George Town, the capital city of the neighbouring state of Penang.</p> 

<p>Due to its close proximity to Penang, Sungai Petani is also part of Greater Penang, Malaysia's second largest conurbation, with the town's logistical needs being served by Penang's well developed transportation infrastructure. Sungai Petani has experienced heavy industrialisation since the 1990s, when Japanese and other international firms began to set up manufacturing plants around the town.</p>
